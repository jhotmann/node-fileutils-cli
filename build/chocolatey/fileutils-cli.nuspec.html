<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <description>## Features
      - Variable replacement and filtering of new file name (powered by [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html))
      - Glob file matching
      - Undo previous rename
      - Customize by adding your own variables and filters
      - Auto-indexing when renaming multiple files to the same name
      - RegEx match/replace
      - Exif data support
      
      ## Usage
      ```rename [options] file(s) new-file-name```
      
      Or simply type `rename` for an interactive cli with live previews of rename operations.
      
      *Note: Windows users (or anyone who wants to type one less letter) can use rname instead of rename since the rename command already exists in Windows*
      
      The new file name does not need to contain a file extension. If you do not specifiy a file extension the original file extension will be preserved.
      
      *Note: if you include periods in your new file name, you should include a file extension to prevent whatever is after the last period from becoming the new extension. I recommend using `.{{ext}}` to preserve the original file etension.*</description>
